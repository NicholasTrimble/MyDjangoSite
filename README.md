Django blog app
A application created with Django. This project was to demonstrate the implementation of MVT architecture, database relationships, and media handling.

Why did I build this?
I built the project to demonstrate the ability to translate my python web development concepts from Flask and FastAPI into the Django ecosystem. It features a content management system for creating, editing, and deleting posts, and also has a responsive frontend for viewing the content.
